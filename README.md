How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
I interpret the user needs by interacting with the stakeholders and learning from them which features should be implemented into the program. I use the information gathered from the stakeholders to create user stories. By creating user stories, the features that need to be implemented are expressed from the perspective of the user and are included with clear completion criteria.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In my future development work, I hope to incorporate the agile processes of user stories and daily Scrum meetings into my work. I think that user stories are useful because they express the requirements of the software in a way that allows you see them from the perspective of the user, which helps to give a better understanding of their purpose. Daily Scrum meetings ensure that good communication is maintained by giving the development team an opportunity to discuss and refine their development process and bring up any issues that need to addressed.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member in software development, I think it is important to be engaged in the project and to contribute to good, professional communication and trust within the team. It is important to stay engaged and to be personally invested in the success of the team while holding yourself accountable to the work that you produce. In order to best influence the team, it is important to contribute to productive communication and to honestly consider suggestion and criticisms from other team members.
